Description: fast and small web browser extensible by Lua, WebKit2 based
 Luakit is a highly-configurable browser framework based on WebKit2GTK+.
 It is very fast and extensible by Lua.  It is primarily targeted at power
 users, developers and any people with too much time on their hands who
 want to have fine-grained control over their web browser's behaviour and
 interface.
